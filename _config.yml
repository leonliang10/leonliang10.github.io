    - work4:
      company: Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company
      location: Sunnyvale, California, United States
      title: Data Scientist Intern
      started: 2016
      duration: (May 2016 - August 2016)
      description: Data Scientist Intern that supported Market Analysis Team within Competitive Intelligence to analyze space industry. Designed a sentiment analysis tool (Java) using NLP to generate LM’s major competitors’ trending using over 3,000 articles scrapped from space industry related news websites for quick market analysis. Developed a predictive analytics tool (R) that predicts project costs using regression trees with existing LM database consisting of over 15,000 data of previous space projects to assist with business strategic planning. Generated statistical reports of estimated project costs from predictive analytics tool results for team to use on market analysis and strategic planning for future space projects.
    - work5:
      company: UC Berkeley Physics
      location: Berkeley, California, United States
      started: 2014
      duration: (August 2014 - May 2016)
      description: Online Database of Extragalactic Transient Theoretical Astrophysics (ODETTA) is an open source astrophysics website and database that uses supernovae data gathered from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to run computer simulations on the NERSC supercomputers to improve our knowledge in supernovae. This research aims to apply machine learning techniques to help analyze and predict the categories of supernova data and its features. Implemented the k-means clustering machine learning algorithm in Python for supernova classification used on the backend server of the ODETTA research website for astrophysicists in laboratory to use. Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract key features of over 1,000,000 data in Python using NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn libraries to build predictive models used for classification. Created a data processing pipeline to process all observed and computer simulated data on backend server.
